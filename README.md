# Kaleidoswap Desktop App

<img src="./docs/logo-kaleido.png" alt="Kaleidoswap Logo" style="width: 50px; height: 50px;">

## Overview

**Kaleidoswap** is an open-source desktop application for decentralized, trustless trading of digital assets over the Bitcoin Lightning Network using the **RGB protocol**. By integrating seamlessly with an [RGB Lightning Node](https://github.com/RGB-Tools/rgb-lightning-node), the app enables multi-asset trading without intermediaries—giving you sovereignty over your funds.

- **Alpha Software Caution**: This software is still in alpha. Swaps may fail or get stuck, and **mainnet usage is not recommended**.  
- **Documentation**: Visit [docs.kaleidoswap.com](https://docs.kaleidoswap.com) for comprehensive guides and additional details.

## Installation 🛠️

You can install the app in two ways:

### 1. Download Binaries

1. **Download** the appropriate binary for your operating system from the [Releases](https://github.com/kaleidoswap/desktop-app/releases) page.

2. **Verify** the download using GPG signatures (recommended for security).

3. **Run** the app by executing the binary.

#### Verifying Downloads with GPG

Each release is signed with a hardware security key (Yubikey) to guarantee authenticity. Download both the binary and its `.asc` signature file, then verify:

**Step 1: Import the public GPG key** (first time only)
```sh
curl https://keybase.io/bitwalt/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

**Step 2: Download binary and signature**
```sh
# Example for Linux (adjust filename for your platform)
curl -LO https://github.com/kaleidoswap/desktop-app/releases/download/v0.3.1/KaleidoSwap_0.3.1_amd64_linux.AppImage
curl -LO https://github.com/kaleidoswap/desktop-app/releases/download/v0.3.1/KaleidoSwap_0.3.1_amd64_linux.AppImage.asc
```

**Step 3: Verify the signature**
```sh
# Linux
gpg --verify KaleidoSwap_0.3.1_amd64_linux.AppImage.asc KaleidoSwap_0.3.1_amd64_linux.AppImage

# macOS (Apple Silicon)
gpg --verify KaleidoSwap_aarch64.app.tar.gz.asc KaleidoSwap_aarch64.app.tar.gz

# macOS (Intel)
gpg --verify KaleidoSwap_x64.app.tar.gz.asc KaleidoSwap_x64.app.tar.gz

# Windows
gpg --verify KaleidoSwap_0.3.1_x64-setup_windows.exe.asc KaleidoSwap_0.3.1_x64-setup_windows.exe
```

**Expected output:**
```
gpg: Good signature from "Walter Maffione <your-email>"
```

> **Note:** The `.asc` files are GPG signatures created post-build with a hardware security key. The `.sig` files in releases are for the app's auto-updater functionality. macOS binaries are also code-signed and notarized by Apple.

### 2. Building Locally

#### Common Prerequisites

- **Tauri 1.6.0**  
  Make sure you have installed all the [official Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) (Rust, Node.js, npm, pnpm).
- **Repository**  
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/kaleidoswap/desktop-app
  cd desktop-app
  ```

#### Windows-Specific Instructions

1. **Disable RLN Integration (Temporarily)**  
   The `rgb-lightning-node` integration is not yet fully supported on Windows. To get started with RLN on Windows, consider using it in a Docker container and connect remotely.
2. **Install vcpkg**  
   Use [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to install libraries like **openssl** and **sqlite3**.
3. **MSVC for C++ Linking**  
   Ensure **Microsoft Visual C++** is installed (usually via Visual Studio or Build Tools).

#### Linux-Specific Instructions

1. **Build Tools and Libraries**  
   Install `build-essential`, `pkg-config`, and SSL libraries on Debian/Ubuntu (or equivalents on other distros).
2. **GTK and WebKit Requirements**  
   Install **libsoup 2.4**, **javascriptcoregtk 4.0**, **webkit2gtk 4.0**, etc.
3. **Tauri Prerequisites**  
   Confirm correct installation of Rust, Node.js, npm, and pnpm.

#### Building and Running

1. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Build the Tauri app**:  
   ```sh
   # For current platform
   pnpm run tauri:build
   
   # For Windows specifically
   pnpm run tauri:build:windows
   
   # Using Make
   make build-app
   ```
3. **Run Kaleidoswap in development mode**:  
   ```sh
   pnpm run tauri:dev
   ```

## Usage 💡

### Connecting to an RGB Lightning Node

1. **Launch** Kaleidoswap.
2. **Configure the Node** in the **Settings** page:
   - Connect to a local or remote instance of [rgb-lightning-node](https://github.com/RGB-Tools/rgb-lightning-node).
   - Provide the correct host/port and any additional configuration details required.

### Trading and Swapping Assets

1. **Select or Add a Market Maker** on the **Settings** page.
   - KaleidoSwap currently provides two built-in makers: one for **regtest** and another for **signet** (mutinynet). Supported assets and pairs can be found at [KaleidoSwap RGB Registry](https://registry.kaleidoswap.com/).
2. **Check Supported Pairs**: Ensure you have at least one Lightning channel funded with the RGB asset you want to trade.
   - If you lack a channel, you can **buy one** from an LSP that supports your chosen RGB asset.
3. **Initiate the Swap**:
   - Go to the trading interface, pick your maker and select a supported trading pair.
   - Accept the RFQ price to execute the swap.

> **Important**: Since Kaleidoswap is in alpha, swaps may fail or get stuck. Check the [docs](https://docs.kaleidoswap.com) for troubleshooting, and feel free to [open an issue](#support-) if you encounter problems.

### Managing Channels

- **Open Channels**: Create channels with custom liquidity and optional RGB assets.
- **Close Channels**: Close channels within the app when no longer needed.
- **Request Channels**: Use the **Buy New Channel** page to request a channel from an LSP, specifying capacity and asset details.

### Deposits and Withdrawals

- Perform Bitcoin or RGB asset deposits/withdrawals either on-chain or via Lightning.
- Monitor your transaction history to verify operations.

### Backup

- Use the **Settings** page to back up your node data. Store your backup securely to prevent data loss.

## Security Considerations 🔒

- **Node Availability**: Keep your node online to ensure consistent Lightning functionality.
- **No API Authentication Yet**: Avoid exposing the node's API to untrusted networks.
- **Alpha Software**: This is alpha software; do not risk real funds or large amounts on mainnet.

## Roadmap 🛣️

### Coming Soon

- **🌍 Multi-language Support:** Broaden accessibility by adding support for multiple languages.

- **📊 Advanced Trading Dashboard:** Support for limit orders, stop-loss, and more advanced trading features.
- **🔗 P2P Trading via Nostr:** Enable decentralized peer-to-peer trading using the Nostr protocol.
- **🔐 TOR Support:** Integrate TOR for enhanced privacy and anonymity.
- **✨ Improved UI/UX Design:** Further refine the user interface for a better overall experience.
